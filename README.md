# cloud-listings-react-client
Front-end client for the firebase functions in https://github.com/dong-alex/cloud-listings-firebase-functions. This is just a test project to develop a better understanding with cloud services.

# Limitations
- The firebase system under my account is disabled, you would need to create your own setup.
- Web scraping applications from a site with consistent changes provided issues that would otherwise not be had there been an API to reference to. Images are not loaded properly as they are loaded realtime and a longer load for listings would not be user friendly. Background processes can be done but would accumulate costs from running the firebase functions.
- Signup/Authentication are based on any email provider, not just via official login portals like Gmail, Github, Facebook, etc.

# Notes
- The firebase system has been disabled. To run this program, the user is required to setup the Firebase on their own and subjected to the potential costs of running the service.
